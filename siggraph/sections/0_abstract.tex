    Gesture generation is a pivotal aspect of multimodal communication systems, enhancing the naturalness and contextuality of human-machine interactions. While significant progress has been made in this field for various languages, gesture generation tailored specifically for Vietnamese remains underexplored. This paper introduces \textbf{DeepGesture}, a diffusion-based gesture generation model base on emotions and semantics.

%Key to bunGesture is its adoption of diffusion-based gesture generation, integrating advanced Vietnamese language models like PhoBERT and the VnCoreNLP toolkit. Additionally, bunGesture employs a fine-tuned Vietnamese version of WaveLM, trained on a custom Vietnamese audio dataset.

%This work emphasizes the importance of language-specific adaptations in gesture generation systems and opens avenues for similar research in other languages.
