% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

%\section{INTRODUCTION}
%
%ICLR requires electronic submissions, processed by
%\url{https://openreview.net/}. See ICLR's website for more instructions.
%
%If your paper is ultimately accepted, the statement {\tt
%  {\textbackslash}iclrfinalcopy} should be inserted to adjust the
%format to the camera ready requirements.
%
%The format for the submissions is a variant of the NeurIPS format.
%Please read carefully the instructions below, and follow them
%faithfully.
%
%\subsection{Style}
%
%Papers to be submitted to ICLR 2025 must be prepared according to the
%instructions presented here.
%
%%% Please note that we have introduced automatic line number generation
%%% into the style file for \LaTeXe. This is to help reviewers
%%% refer to specific lines of the paper when they make their comments. Please do
%%% NOT refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will be removed from the
%%% style file for the final version of accepted papers.
%
%Authors are required to use the ICLR \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
%ICLR website. Please make sure you use the current files and
%not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for rejection.
%
%\subsection{Retrieval of style files}
%
%The style files for ICLR and other conference information are available online at:
%\begin{center}
%   \url{http://www.iclr.cc/}
%\end{center}
%The file \verb+iclr2025_conference.pdf+ contains these
%instructions and illustrates the
%various formatting requirements your ICLR paper must satisfy.
%Submissions must be made using \LaTeX{} and the style files
%\verb+iclr2025_conference.sty+ and \verb+iclr2025_conference.bst+ (to be used with \LaTeX{}2e). The file
%\verb+iclr2025_conference.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your paper. All you
%have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of the paper with
%your own.
%
%The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
%sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.
